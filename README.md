# Programadora Brasil's redesign

A project based on Josh Miller's Angular boilerplate ([ngbp]).

## Setting up testing/production environment

- Clone the repository
- Install Node/npm, Bower and less, if not present
- Install Grunt for build routines and Karma for testing with: sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
- Install Grunt dependencies: npm install
- Install JS dependencies* (/vendor): bower install

**All dependencies are listed in the bower.json file, so everytime a new one is needed, the referred file must be updated*

## Developement structure

In the project site, the structure's description is pretty straightforward:

project/
  |- grunt-tasks/
  |- karma/
  |- src/
  |  |- app/
  |  |  |- <app logic>
  |  |- assets/
  |  |  |- <static files>
  |  |- common/
  |  |  |- <reusable code>
  |  |- less/
  |  |  |- main.less
  |- vendor/
  |  |- angular-bootstrap/
  |  |- bootstrap/
  |  |- placeholders/
  |- .bowerrc
  |- bower.json
  |- build.config.js
  |- Gruntfile.js
  |- module.prefix
  |- module.suffix
  |- package.json

- `karma/` - test configuration.
- `src/` - our application sources.
- `vendor/` - third-party libraries. [Bower](http://bower.io) will install
  packages here. Anything added to this directory will need to be manually added
  to `build.config.js` and `karma/karma-unit.js` to be picked up by the build
  system.
- `.bowerrc` - the Bower configuration file. This tells Bower to install
  components into the `vendor/` directory.
- `bower.json` - this is our project configuration for Bower and it contains the
  list of Bower dependencies we need.
- `build.config.js` - our customizable build settings; see "The Build System"
  below.
- `Gruntfile.js` - our build script; see "The Build System" below.
- `module.prefix` and `module.suffix` - our compiled application script is
  wrapped in these, which by default are used to place the application inside a
  self-executing anonymous function to ensure no clashes with other libraries.
- `package.json` - metadata about the app, used by NPM and our build script. Our
  NPM dependencies are listed here.
